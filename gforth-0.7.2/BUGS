gforth.el: indentation does not work right on the first line of a
buffer. anton 27jan95

Conditional compilation continues after the file ends. This is allowed
by the standard (through an ambiguous condition), but the compiler
should at least produce a warning.  anton 27jan95

QUERY and TIB may behave differently than some may expect. TIB always
points to the current SOURCE, and QUERY puts its result there.  anton
28nov96

open-path-file expands "./" into the sourcefilename. It should either
not expand "./" or provide a mechanism that allows the application to
determine what "./" should expand to. anton 16jun98

gforth.el: Typing <ret> does not work when tabs separate words in a
line, and there is a \-comment at the end of the line.  anton 19feb00

SEE does not work when the control structure is too complex (e.g.,
load http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/pentomino.fs and then do
SEE NEXT-PIECE). anton 5mar2000

Include cannot handle lines longer than 255 characters.  anton 4sep00

Errors happening during a LOAD do not report the offending word and
its context (e.g., the 64-byte line). anton 8sep00

Our ecvt routine apparently does not work correctly for Infs and NaNs.
Try "ac_cv_func_ecvt=no ./configure; make" and then in Gforth: "1e 0e
f/ f. 0e 0e f/ f.". anton 25sep00

Our ecvt routine does not round correctly, e.g., 0.25->0.3. Marcel
Hendrix 3oct00 <8rdcmd$j96$1@news.IAEhv.nl>

Newline has only LF (instead of CRLF) in DOS.  Bruce Hoyt 25oct2000
<39f7b14b$2@clear.net.nz>

F. does not print trailing zeroes (e.g., "10 SET-PRECISION 125e f.")
anton 31may01

Block 0 does not work as it should: "0 block drop update save-buffers"
does not write to the blocks file.  "0 block 1024 dump" seems to give
the previous contents of the buffer.  Travis Bemann 10jul2001
<3b4b4f57$0$42883$272ea4a1@news.execpc.com>

When accessing a block beyond the end of the block file, the result is
filled with spaces (this is also documented).  However, when accessing
a previously unwritten block before the end of the block file, we will
get a block full of zeroes on most (all?) OSs.  This inconsistency
should be eliminated and the documentation fixed.  anton 14jul2001

Path handling may have a bug:
strace $FORTH 'fpath= .|~+/gforth s" /home/anton/threading-variations/gforth/mach32b.fs" include gforth/kernel/main.fs bye'
tries to open gforth/kernel/gforth/kernel/aliases.fs, then
gforth/gforth/kernel/aliases.fs, but not gforth/kernel/aliases.fs.
anton 3 sep 2001

gforth-native does not deal correctly with inline arguments in static
superinstructions: when using lit_lit, the wrong literals are put into
the native code (probably due to wrong assumptions about argument
offsets). 6 nov 2003

finish-code changes the stack for gforth-fast with --enable-force-reg
(probably for gforth-native too).  Apparently ecx (spTOS) is neither
saved by engine, nor by finish_code().

Wrong decompilation:
create foo
5 constant bar
: xxx foo bar ;
simple-see xxx

Debian's gforth's etags.fs crashes (probably due to path problems)
on b3:
gforth etags.fs
