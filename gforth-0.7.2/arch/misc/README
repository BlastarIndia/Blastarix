This directory contains simulator, assembler and primitives for the
MISC-chip.

Information about the MISC processor can be found at: www.mixed-mode.de

Create a gforth image for the misc simulator with:

make kernl-misc.fi

Load this image into the simulator and run the simulator with:

gforth arch/misc/sim.fs -e "load kernl-misc.fi g"

Additionally, there are two more complex examples (two terminal games,
Sokoban and Tetris). To create the image, add:

include arch/misc/sokoban.fs
include arch/misc/tt.fs

in kernel/main.fs (they are commented out by default) then perform a make
kernl-misc.fi as above. Move the result to games-misc.fi, and start
the simulator:

mv kernl-misc.fi games-misc.fi
gforth arch/misc/sim.fs -e "load games-misc.fi g"

Now type in "sokoban" <return> or "tt" <return> to play sokoban or
tetris (be aware: both are very slow!). To stop either game, type "q".
