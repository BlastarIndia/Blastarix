This directory contains assembler and primitives for the 4stack
processor.

Information about the 4stack processor, including a description of the
architecture, a user manual, a simulator, and a description of a
sample implementation in Verilog can be found at:
http://www.jwdt.com/~paysan/4stack.html

Create a gforth image for the 4stack simulator with:

make kernl-4stack.fi

This also creates the file gforth.4o for the simulator in the directory
arch/4stack.

Load this image into the simulator and run the simulator with:

cd arch/4stack; 4stack gforth.4o

Additionally, there are two more complex examples (two terminal games,
Sokoban and Tetris). To create the image, add:

include arch/misc/sokoban.fs
include arch/misc/tt.fs

in kernel/main.fs (they are commented out by default) then perform a make
kernl-4stack.fi as above. Move the resulting gforth.4o to
gforth-games.4o, and start the simulator:

cd arch/4stack
mv gforth.4o gforth-games.4o
4stack gforth-games.4o

Now type in "sokoban" <return> or "tt" <return> to play sokoban or
tetris (both run at reasonable speed on a Pentium 133). To stop either
game, type "q".
