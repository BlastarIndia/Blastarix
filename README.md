This is going to be a rewrite from GNU/Linux Kernel 3.12 stable. That might change as we progress.

You have to understand that our funding is limited, and we are looking for investors. Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Dell, HP/Compaq, and many others are struggling. They cannot innovate anymore, and the only true innovators left are free software and open source developers. You will see Ubuntu Touch, Tizen, QNX, and many others rise up as the rest of them fall because they cannot do quality control anymore and have no idea what six sigma, contrinual improvement, unit testing, agile and lean developemt, or even what extreme programming means. They have gotten fat and greedy and released poor quality hardware and software. Only Android seems to be the leader right now and ChromeOS is picking up, but are GNU/Linux based as are Ubuntu Touch and Tizen. In 2014 PC OEMS are rebelling against Microsoft and Microsoft Windows, and looking for alternatives. Blastarix aims to be one of those alternatives.
