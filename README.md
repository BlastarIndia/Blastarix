This project is still in the planning stages, has not received any seed money or VC support yet, and we tried a Kickstarter but failed.

It looks like we are on our own with this, so expect delays unless something changes.

Norman King, aka GeneralRAM at generalram@sbcglobal.net for the main 'super debugger' trying to get all of this code to work properly.

Our future goals is to make Blastarix work with QEMU virtual machines and incorporate gFORTH as a develoment language for neuronetworks and virtual neurons.

This project is at the earliest stages right now, don't expect too much. We need a lot of help to pull this off.

We really need your help and support on this project. When the Neurochips are implanted into our brains, you will want free software you can modify instead of closed source software you cannot modify that has backdoors in it.
